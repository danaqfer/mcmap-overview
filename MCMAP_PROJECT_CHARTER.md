# Model Context Marketing and Advertising Protocol (MCMAP) Project Charter

## Executive Summary

The **Model Context Marketing and Advertising Protocol (MCMAP)** is an industry standards initiative to extend the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for marketing and advertising technology (MarTech/AdTech) use cases. MCMAP defines standardized frameworks, plugins, and agentic workflow patterns that enable AI-powered marketing tools to operate with built-in compliance, governance, and industry vocabulary while supporting diverse organizational structures and multi-stakeholder approval processes.

## Project Vision

**"To establish MCMAP as the universal standard for AI-powered marketing and advertising workflows, enabling seamless, compliant, and efficient agentic automation across the entire marketing ecosystem."**

## Problem Statement

The marketing and advertising industry faces critical challenges in adopting AI agents and automation:

### Current Pain Points
- **Fragmented Standards**: No unified protocol for marketing tool integration
- **Compliance Complexity**: Privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA) and brand safety requirements are inconsistently enforced
- **Vocabulary Inconsistency**: Different platforms use conflicting terminology for campaigns, audiences, placements
- **Workflow Rigidity**: Existing systems cannot adapt to diverse organizational structures (agency vs. in-house vs. hybrid)
- **Approval Bottlenecks**: Multi-stakeholder approval processes are manual and inefficient
- **AI Integration Gaps**: Limited standardization for human-AI collaboration in marketing workflows

### Business Impact
- Increased operational costs due to manual processes
- Compliance risks from inconsistent governance
- Reduced marketing effectiveness from fragmented data and processes
- Slower time-to-market for campaigns and initiatives
- Limited scalability of marketing operations

## Strategic Goals

**Core Pillars:**

### 1. **Interoperability**
- Enable seamless AI agent communication across different vendors and platforms
- Establish universal vocabulary standards that work across the entire MarTech/AdTech ecosystem
- Reduce integration complexity through consistent terminology and data structures
- Support multi-vendor workflows without vendor lock-in

### 2. **Reliability through Reduced Semantic Drift**
- Prevent AI inference inconsistencies across multi-step workflows
- Maintain semantic consistency as context passes between different AI agents
- Reduce entropy in AI decision-making through standardized terminology
- Ensure predictable AI behavior regardless of vendor or platform

### 3. **Agility and Rapid Evolution**
- Enable quick adaptation to rapidly changing AI and MarTech/AdTech landscape
- Provide flexible foundation that evolves with emerging technologies
- Support innovation without breaking existing implementations
