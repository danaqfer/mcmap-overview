# MCMAP Organization Structure

This document outlines the **Model Context Marketing and Advertising Protocol (MCMAP)** organization structure, designed to mirror the [Model Context Protocol organization](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol) while being hosted under the `danaqfer` GitHub account for initial development.

## üèóÔ∏è Organization Pattern
